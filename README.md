# Cloud-Email-Analyzer
Our project is a cloud-native platform that scans email attachments to detect and analyze potential threats. Incoming emails are parsed, their attachments uploaded to AWS, and then processed through a secure pipeline. Each file is first triaged in isolated containers, where static scanners and text-only extraction detect common malware and suspicious patterns quickly and safely. If advanced behavior analysis is required—such as running Office macros or Windows executables—the system escalates the attachment into a temporary, isolated virtual machine sandbox for deeper inspection.

The results are enriched with AI that extracts indicators of compromise (IoCs), scores the likelihood of maliciousness, and generates concise human-readable reports. Suspicious emails are quarantined and notifications are sent to users and administrators. This approach combines cybersecurity techniques, AI intelligence, and cloud orchestration into one integrated toolkit that demonstrates real-world protection against malicious email attachments.
